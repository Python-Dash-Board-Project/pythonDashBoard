### Instructions:

# Set up a Git repository:
Choose a service such as GitHub or GitLab to host your repository, and create a new repository for your project. Follow the instructions provided by the service to create the repository and set it up in IntelliJ IDEA.

# Share the repository: Invite the other programmer to the repository as a collaborator. This will give them access to the code and allow them to make changes to it.

# Make and commit changes: Each programmer should make their own changes to the code and commit them to the repository. When you commit your changes, you should write a clear and concise commit message that explains what you have changed and why.

# Push and pull changes: When you are ready to share your changes with the other programmer, push them to the repository. The other programmer should then pull the changes from the repository to update their local copy of the code.

# Resolve conflicts: If you both make changes to the same part of the code, you may encounter a conflict when you try to push or pull changes. In this case, you will need to resolve the conflict by deciding which changes to keep or merge. IntelliJ IDEA can help you resolve conflicts by providing tools such as the Conflict Resolver.

# Remember to communicate with the other programmer and coordinate your work to avoid conflicts and ensure that you are both working towards the same goals. It's also a good idea to use a branching strategy to manage your changes and minimize the risk of conflicts.
